# LiveProject - JobPDX
Snippets of sample code from a database-driven actively updated job listing web site, currently under development, built using code first approach in .NET Entity Framework. My primary role was to add the functionality for users to save individual job listings and companies that they were interested in to database tables, and construct personal “dashboard” views where the users could view and delete these listings.
